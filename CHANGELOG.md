## [Unreleased]

### 🚀 Added - 2025-08-05

#### Redis Cache & ChromaDB Integration - Sprint 3.2.1, 3.2.2 & 3.2.3 ✅ COMPLETED
Sprint 3.2.1:
- ✅ Added Redis 7-alpine to docker-compose.minimal.yml (commit: 20ce0bc)
- ✅ Configured Redis on port 6380 to avoid local conflicts
- ✅ Added health checks for Redis container
- ✅ Set up REDIS_URL environment variable for app integration
- ✅ Implemented `/api/cache-test` endpoint with TTL support
- ✅ Added Redis client with graceful fallback in app.py
- ✅ Fixed Redis dependency in requirements-crewai.txt
- ✅ Verified cache functionality with successful test response

Sprint 3.2.2:
- ✅ Implemented caching for `/api/analyze-potential` endpoint
- ✅ Cache key format: `analysis:{folder_name}`
- ✅ Cache TTL: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- ✅ Added `from_cache` field to response
- ✅ Verified: First call returns `from_cache: false`, subsequent calls `from_cache: true`
- 📊 Performance: Cache hits reduce response time from ~2ms to ~1ms

Sprint 3.2.3:
- ✅ Added ChromaDB to docker-compose.minimal.yml on port 8001
- ✅ Configured persistent storage for ChromaDB
- ✅ Integrated ChromaDB client with health check
- ✅ Created Vector Wave style guide collection
- ✅ Implemented `/api/style-guide/seed` endpoint with 8 initial rules
- ✅ Implemented `/api/style-guide/check` endpoint with Naive RAG
- ✅ Style scoring system (0-100) with violations and suggestions
- ✅ Platform-specific rules (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
- 📊 Performance: Naive RAG queries return in <5ms

Sprint 3.2.4:
- ✅ Implemented `/api/style-guide/check-agentic` endpoint with CrewAI agent
- ✅ Created Style Guide Expert Agent for intelligent analysis
- ✅ Integrated ChromaDB rules with agent reasoning (RAG + Agent)
- ✅ Agent provides alternative openings and CTA recommendations
- ✅ Added focus areas: engagement, clarity, brand_voice, viral_potential
- ✅ Implemented `/api/style-guide/compare` endpoint for method comparison
- ✅ Full analysis text with actionable improvements
- 📊 Performance: 12-18s with GPT-4, cost $0.02-0.05 per analysis
- 🚀 Next Sprint: 3.2.5 - Production Docker Compose

#### Draft Generation Fixes & Optimization
- ✅ Fixed "Failed to start writing flow" error (was returning 404)
- ✅ Changed endpoint from `/api/generate-draft-v2` to `/api/generate-draft`
- ✅ Added data transformation in frontend proxy to match backend format
- ✅ Fixed response format mismatch (backend `status: "completed"` → frontend `success: true`)
- ✅ Implemented skip_research optimization for ORIGINAL content
- ✅ Added execution time tracking and optimization logging
- ✅ Reduced draft generation time by ~20% for ORIGINAL content (25s → 20s)

#### Container-First Development
- ✅ Updated pragmatic approach documentation after "linear flow" lessons learned
- ✅ Implemented Minimal Viable Change (MVC) methodology
- ✅ Total fix: ~30 lines of code vs potential 2-day complex solution
