    max_execution_time_seconds=300.0,  # 5 minutes max test time
    max_concurrent_operations=50,   # Maximum concurrent operations
    memory_growth_rate_mb_per_sec=10.0  # Memory leak detection
)
```

## Configuration

### Test Environment Setup

No external dependencies required - the test suite is completely standalone and simulates the AI Writing Flow V2 system behavior.

### Customizing Test Parameters

```python
# Custom resource thresholds for different environments
custom_thresholds = ResourceThresholds(
    max_memory_mb=2048.0,  # 2GB for production-like testing
    max_cpu_percent=95.0,  # Allow higher CPU usage
    max_execution_time_seconds=600.0,  # 10 minutes for extended testing
)

stress_tester = HeavyLoadStressTester(custom_thresholds)
```

### Mock Flow Configuration

```python
# Configure mock flow characteristics
mock_flow = MockAIWritingFlowV2(
    processing_time_base=0.1,  # Base processing time in seconds
    failure_rate=0.05  # 5% failure rate for realistic testing
)
```

## Success Criteria

### Performance Benchmarks

- **Concurrent Load**: System handles 15+ concurrent operations with >70% success rate
- **Memory Pressure**: Maintains >50% success rate under memory constraints
- **CPU Saturation**: Sustains >60% success rate under high CPU load
- **Capacity Limits**: Identifies maximum capacity (typically 8-16+ operations)
- **Recovery**: Achieves >75% success rate after stress periods

### Resource Utilization

- **Memory Usage**: No excessive growth (< 1GB increase during testing)
- **CPU Efficiency**: Proper utilization without system lockup
- **Recovery Time**: System recovers within 60 seconds post-stress
- **Stability**: No crashes or unrecoverable states

## Best Practices

### Before Running Tests

1. **System Resources**: Ensure adequate memory and CPU availability
2. **Background Processes**: Minimize other system load during testing
3. **Test Duration**: Allow sufficient time for complete test execution

### Interpreting Results

1. **Success Rates**: Focus on trends rather than absolute numbers
2. **Resource Usage**: Monitor peak usage and growth patterns  
3. **Breaking Points**: Use capacity findings for production planning
4. **Recovery Metrics**: Validate system resilience and stability

### Production Considerations

1. **Capacity Planning**: Use breaking point results for scaling decisions
2. **Monitoring Thresholds**: Apply learnings to production alerting
3. **Circuit Breaker Tuning**: Adjust thresholds based on test findings
4. **Resource Allocation**: Plan memory and CPU requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Timeouts**: Increase `max_execution_time_seconds` for slower systems
2. **Memory Limits**: Adjust `max_memory_mb` based on available system memory
3. **CPU Saturation**: Lower `max_cpu_percent` on systems with limited CPU
4. **Concurrent Limits**: Reduce maximum concurrent operations for resource-constrained environments

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run with verbose logging
pytest tests/test_heavy_load_standalone.py -v -s --log-cli-level=DEBUG -m performance
```

### Manual Test Execution

```python
# Direct execution for debugging
python3 tests/test_heavy_load_standalone.py
```
