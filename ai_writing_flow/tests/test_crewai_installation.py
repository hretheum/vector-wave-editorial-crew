CrewAI Installation Compatibility Test - Task 1.2

This test suite validates that CrewAI 0.152.0 installation doesn't break 
existing system functionality and integrates correctly with our infrastructure.

Test Categories:
1. Basic CrewAI imports and version validation
2. Import conflict detection with existing modules
3. Memory footprint impact assessment
4. Core system component preservation
5. Knowledge Base integration compatibility
6. Linear execution chain compatibility

Success Criteria:
- All CrewAI core components import successfully
- No import conflicts with existing modules
- Memory impact within acceptable limits (<50MB increase)
- Existing LinearExecutionChain works unchanged
- Knowledge Base adapter continues to function
- No performance degradation in core workflows
